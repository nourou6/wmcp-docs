== A. Compliance to WMO Core Profile and its mandatory elements
////
They should be derived from WMCP documentation part 2 and the rubric
checker. To be done
////


=== XML encoding : ISO/TS 19139:2007 Compliance

==== To which WMCP element(s) does it apply?
Whole metadata record

==== What is being measured?
Metadata record structure conforms to ISO/TS 19139:2007 standard : A WCMP Metadata record shall validate without error against 
- the XML schema defined in  ISO/TS 19139:2007. ( add links here )  
- the rule-based contraints listed in ISO/TS 19139:2007 Annex A Table A1


==== Why should we measure it?
An invalid metadata record will be rejected by the WIS DAR catalog, so related datasets won’t be discoverables and accessibles.

==== How is the measurement executed?
Validation tools supporting both full W3C XML Schema and Schematron rules, rubric checker.

==== What is (are) considered valid results?
No error in checker output

==== Guidance to score well on this assessment
Use WCMP templates and/or tools to generate the metadata record (ex excel to wis)
validate the metadata record using rubric checker before publishing it



=== XML encoding : explicit namespace identification 

==== To which WMCP element(s) does it apply?
Whole metadata record, namespace declaration 

==== What is being measured?
Each element is prefixed with it’s namespace prefix  (ie : gmd gmx, ...)

==== Why should we measure it?
To avoid collisions among elements from different packages in a metadata record 

==== How is the measurement executed?
Inspect all "xmlns" declarations to ensure that an XML namespace is explicitely provided

==== What is (are) considered valid results?
Foreach declaration, an XML namesace is provided

==== Guidance to score well on this assessment
Use WCMP templates and/or tools to generate the metadata record (e.g. excel to wis)
Validate the metadata record using rubric checker before publishing it


=== XML encoding : Use of GML 3.2

==== To which WMCP element(s) does it apply?
Whole metadata record, namespace declaration 

==== What is being measured?
inspect "xmlns" declaration to ensure that gml nanespace is specified as xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gmd/3.2

==== Why should we measure it?
Wcmp 1.3 depends on gml 3.2.  A metadata record using another gml version may be rejected by the WIS DAR catalog.

==== How is the measurement executed?
Tools recommended in WCMP ATS, like rubric checker 

==== What is (are) considered valid results?
gml nanespace is specified as xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gmd/3.2

==== Guidance to score well on this assessment
Use WCMP templates and/or tools to generate the metadata record (e.g. excel to wis)
Validate the metadata record using rubric checker before publishing it


===  uniqueness of metadata : presence of the FileIdentifier element 

==== To which WMCP element(s) does it apply?
gmd:MD_Metadata/gmd:fileIdentifier

==== What is being measured?
Presence of gmd:FileIdentifier element in the metadata record.
The gmd:FileIdentifier value is an URI compliant with the specified stucture in WCMP Part 1

==== Why should we measure it?
To ensure uniqueness of the metadata record within the WIS.

==== How is the measurement executed?
Tools recommended in WCMP ATS, like rubric checker 

==== What is (are) considered valid results?
No error related to the presence of  gmd:FileIdentifier in rubric output

==== Guidance to score well on this assessment
Validate the metadata record  using rubric checker before publishing it. 
Does rubric check URL compliance ? 


=== discovery rules within the DAR catalogue : presence of the mandatory WMO_CategoryCode keyword 

==== To which WMCP element(s) does it apply?
gmd:MD_Metadata/gmd:identificationInfo/gmd:DataIndentification/gmd:descriptiveKeywords/gmd:Keywords/gmd:keyword
gmd:MD_Metadata/gmd:identificationInfo/gmd:DataIndentification/gmd:descriptiveKeywords/gmd:Keywords/gmd:keyword/gmd:Type/gmd:MD_KeywordTypeCode

==== What is being measured?
Presence of at least one keyword from the WMO_CategoryCode code list.
Each keyword provided from WMO_CategoryCode code list must be of type "theme", from MD_KeywordTypeCode code list.
All keywords sourced from a particular keyword thesaurus shall be grouped into a single instance of MD_Keywords class.

==== Why should we measure it?
Provide additional topic categories for data discovery in WMO community

==== How is the measurement executed?
Tools recommended in WCMP ATS, like rubric checker 

==== What is (are) considered valid results?
No error related to gmd:topicCategory in checker’s output : there is at least one keyword from  WMO_CategoryCode code list in the matadata record, each keyword provided if of type "theme" from MD_KeywordType code list, and all keywords sourced from a particular keyword thesaurus are grouped into a single instance of MD_Keywords class.

==== Guidance to score well on this assessment
Use WCMP templates and/or tools to generate the metadata record (e.g. excel to wis)
validate the metadata record using rubric checker before publishing it



=== discovery rules within the DAR catalogue : presence of geographic data extent defined by a bounding box

==== To which WMCP element(s) does it apply?
gmd:MD_Metadata/gmd:identificationInfo/gmd:DataIndentification/gmd:extent/gmd:EX_Extent/gmd:geographicElement/gmd:EX_GeographicBoundingBox

==== What is being measured?
Presence of gmd:EX_GeographicBoundingBox

==== Why should we measure it?
Provide the geographic extent of the dataset for data discovery based on location

==== How is the measurement executed?
Tools recommended in WCMP ATS, like rubric checker 

==== What is (are) considered valid results?
No error related to EX_GeographicBoundingBox in checker’s output

==== Guidance to score well on this assessment
Use WCMP templates and/or tools to generate the metadata record (e.g. excel to wis)
Validate the metadata record using rubric checker before publishing it



=== Correct description of data for global exchange via WIS : Identifying data for global exchange

==== To which WMCP element(s) does it apply?
gmd:MD_Metadata/gmd:identificationInfo/gmd:DataIndentification/gmd:descriptiveKeywords/gmd:Keywords/gmd:keyword

==== What is being measured?
Presence of the keyword "GlobalExchange" from the WMO_DistributionScopeCode code list.
the "GlobalExchange" keyword must be of type "dataCentre", from MD_KeywordTypeCode code list.

==== Why should we measure it?
It is important to identify datasets to be  globally exchanged via the WIS in order to store them in the cache.

==== How is the measurement executed?
Check the presence of "GlobalExchange" keyword.

==== What is (are) considered valid results?
Presence of the "GlobalExchange" keyword, for a dataset "supposed" to be globally exchanged. 
Problem : how to identify a dataset for global exchange, given the GlobalExchange" keyword is not specified ? 

==== Guidance to score well on this assessment
Use WCMP templates and/or tools to generate the metadata record (e.g. excel to wis)



=== Correct description of data for global exchange via WIS : specification of WMO data policy for globally exchanged data

==== To which WMCP element(s) does it apply?
gmd:MD_Metadata/gmd:identificationInfo//gmd:ressourceConstraints/gmd:MD_LegalConstraints/gmd:otherConstraints

==== What is being measured?
presence of one and only one instance of a term from the WMO_DataLicense code list 

==== Why should we measure it?
To be able to implement and enforce data policies related to Resolution 25 and 40 resolution and other regulations, like ICAO Annex 3

==== How is the measurement executed?
Tools recommended in WCMP ATS, like rubric checker 

==== What is (are) considered valid results?
No error related to WMO_DataLicense in checker’s output

==== Guidance to score well on this assessment
Use WCMP templates and/or tools to generate the metadata record (e.g. excel to wis)
Validate the metadata record using rubric checker before publishing it


=== Correct description of data for global exchange via WIS : specification of GTS priority for globally exchanged data

==== To which WMCP element(s) does it apply?
gmd:MD_Metadata/gmd:identificationInfo//gmd:ressourceConstraints/gmd:MD_LegalConstraints/gmd:otherConstraints

==== What is being measured?
presence of one and only one instance of a term from the WMO_GTSProductCategoryCode code list 

==== Why should we measure it?
To be able to implement and enforce GTS prioriy for data exchanges via the WIS.

==== What is (are) considered valid results?
No error related to WMO_DataLicense in checker’s output
